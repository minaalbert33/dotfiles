## Why using Suckless Tools ?
   Suckless offers bunch of softwares like dwm, st, dmenu, slock and dwmblocks that are very minimal<br> 
   and even don't have configuration files , u need to edit the source code and recompile the software <br> 
   if you want to add a feature then u need to patch the software and recompile it
 
## NOTES:
- All the keybindings related to windows and other ones are located in .config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc
- Some packages are in the official repositories and other from the AUR (Arch User Repository)
