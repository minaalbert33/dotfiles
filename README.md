This is the configuration of my Arch linux System using [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/) (Xorg)

## Common Packages
- Window Manager : dwm
- Terminal Multiplexer: tmux
- Text Editor: nvim
- Image Viewer: sxiv
- Video Player: vlc
- Document Viewer: zathura (vim based keybindings)
- Zathura pdf plugin: zathura-pdf-mupdf
- Font: ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd
- Menu: dmenu 
- Web Browser: brave-bin 
- Recording tool: ffmpeg
- Machine Emulator & Virtualizer : qemu

## NOTES:
- All the keybindings related to windows and other ones are located in .config/hypr/files/binds.conf
- Some packages are in the official repositories and other from the AUR (Arch User Repository)
- All the scripts use **/bin/sh** to execute so all of them are **POSIX compliant scripts**
